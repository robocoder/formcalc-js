# Naming

## Status

Accepted

## Context

`formcalc-js` is a JavaScript (ECMAScript) implementation of the [XFA-FormCalc](https://www.w3.org/1999/05/XFA/xfa-formcalc.html) grammar.

## Decision

Names matter. The choice of name is intentionally similar yet distinctive so as to not be construed as an official
implementation or affiliated with JetForm/Adobe.

## Consequences

* in 1999, JetForm (later acquired by Adobe) submitted XFA-FormCalc to the W3C
* in 2017, the XFA (XML Forms Architecture) was deprecated by the ISO technical committee overseeing the PDF standard
* surprisingly, CIPO, USPTO, and EUIPO searches on 2025-01-25 shows no matches for the word mark "FormCalc"
